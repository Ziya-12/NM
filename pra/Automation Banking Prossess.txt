4. 💳 Automation Banking Process
✅ Problem Analysis & Project Planning:
Traditional banking requires users to visit branches, causing delays. ATM and automation reduce human effort and errors.

🎯 Objective:
To create a system that handles basic ATM functions like withdrawal, deposit, balance check, and user authentication.

📌 Scope:
ATM access and authentication

Account management

Basic transactions (withdraw, deposit)

Admin and user roles

📝 Problem Statement:
Manual banking processes are slow and labor-intensive. An automated ATM-based system can provide quick, accurate, and secure transactions.
