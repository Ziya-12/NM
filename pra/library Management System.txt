3. 📚 Library Management System
✅ Problem Analysis & Project Planning:
Managing books, users, and transactions manually in libraries is time-consuming and leads to misplaced records.

🎯 Objective:
To automate book issuing, returning, and tracking for students, faculty, and librarians.

📌 Scope:
Manage books, journals, and magazines

Issue/return tracking

User management (student, faculty, librarian)

Fine calculation (optional)

📝 Problem Statement:
Manual library systems are inefficient and error-prone. An automated system ensures fast and reliable service for book management.
