Student.java 

public class Student {
    public int studentID;
    public String name;
    public String email;

    public void viewResult() {
        // logic to view result
    }
}

course.java 

public class Course {
    public String courseID;
    public String courseName;
    public int credits;

    public void displayCourseInfo() {
        // logic to display course information
    }
}

faculty.java 

public class Faculty {
    public int facultyID;
    public String name;
    public String department;

    public void assignMarks() {
        // logic to assign marks to students
    }
}

Result.java 

public class Result {
    public int studentID;
    public String subject;
    public int marks;

    public void generateGrade() {
        // logic to calculate grade based on marks
    }
}


Admin.java

public class Admin {
    public int adminID;

✅ Problem Analysis & Project Planning:
Manual result handling is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating the result process ensures accuracy, quick access, and secure record-keeping.

🎯 Objective:
To develop a system that allows storing, managing, and viewing student results efficiently.

📌 Scope:
Store student records and marks

Generate grade reports

Faculty can upload and manage marks

Students can view their results

📝 Problem Statement:
In many institutions, maintaining student result records manually leads to data inconsistency and delays. An automated system is needed to simplify and secure this process.
